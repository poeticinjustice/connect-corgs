Connect Corgs!

You got it. I’m making connect four with pictures of corgis. These oblong dogs will battle it out at their rounds ends: their foxy faces and bouncy butts.

That’s the only goal, initially. If I can figure out how to make the connect four part work well, and I’m feeling ambitious, then I hope to add features like having the user choose the size of the grid (between three and nine in each direction—maybe less to keep it reasonably responsive) and choosing the number of connected corgs (also between three and nine). Ultimately, I’d like it to look like the images are falling into place, fading in and out as they pass each hole. Maybe the could randomly rotate too. 

At first, it would be one corgi’s butt and another corgi’s face that would duel, but I would like to have arrays of images of different color corgwn (the plural of corgis if you speak Welsh, the dog’s indigenous language) that would duke it out. I would even consider adding inferior animals like cats or c0derz. 

Before I add the pseudocode, why is my pdf pink? There's no such thing as a pink corgi!
